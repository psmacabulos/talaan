Short, plain-language notes explaining things along the way — for whenever I want a reminder later. Newest entries at the bottom.

## Moving files in Bash (`mv`)
`mv <source> <destination>` moves or renames a file/folder. `./` as the destination means "the current folder."

To move only *some* files out of a folder (and skip others), list each one by name instead of using a wildcard:
```bash
mv tempo/talaan/package.json ./
mv tempo/talaan/src ./
```
A wildcard (`mv tempo/talaan/* ./`) moves *everything*, which is risky if you need to skip a few files — like the generated `CLAUDE.md` we didn't want to overwrite, or `node_modules`, which is better reinstalled fresh. Also, `*` alone doesn't match dotfiles (like `.gitignore`) — that needs a separate pattern: `.[!.]* `.

Delete a folder (and everything in it) with `rm -rf <folder>`: `-r` = recursive (include subfolders), `-f` = don't ask for confirmation.
